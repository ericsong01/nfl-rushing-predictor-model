# Introduction 
This project was created to solve Kaggle's NFL Big Data Bowl prompt of predicting the cumulative probability of an NFL rusher achieving a certain number of yards
on a play. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020)

nflbigdatacleaned_2.ipynb details my process in developing a random forests model to solve the problem

# Future Plans
I am currently working on deploying this model in an API, and building a simple website for creating real-time predictions during live NFL games
