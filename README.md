# Introduction 
This project was created to solve Kaggle's NFL Big Data Bowl prompt of predicting the cumulative probability of an NFL rusher achieving a certain number of yards

# Future
I am currently working on deploying this model in an API, and building a simple website for creating real-time predictions during live NFL games
